This is my first attempt to create some sort of survey tool where people can click on some sort of front-end UI to fill out a form that sends the information to a database.


The way I see it, there are three parts to this

1. Front-End
2. Some sort of Backend API
3. Back End Database



# Middle API Connection #

I am going to start with the middle part of this for now as it is the most familiar to me. Hopefully getting some traction going will motivate me to to push through and finish this project.
